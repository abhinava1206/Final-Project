# Final Project
## Project - Compression Widget

I will create a program that will accept a file, use 3 different kinds of compression and return the smallest compressed file. I will also create a decompressor/ extractor that converts compressed files back to their original forms. If there is time, I will develop my own compression algorithm. I will also work towards designing a GUI/Widget using Qt. Some topics from PIC classes that I expect to use are inheritance, polymorphism and file manipulation. I would love to hear suggestions/ feedback on my idea.
